Impresent is a Webapp to manage student presence during time of COVID, when schools can't afford to have everyone on site.

The app should be used by : 

- The class representative
- The students

The workflow is the following

The class representative :

1. Can create a class (promotion)
2. Adds the students to his class (csv imports supported)
3. Can create a day of presence for a target date
4. Share the volunteering link to the class
5. Waits for the students volunteer using the link
6. Can add people that have not volunteered to reach the minimum of attendees, based on their last presence date
7. Can export the final presence list for the day to send it to the school admin

Future in developement : 

- Students can unvolunteer
- Min and max attendees for a given day can be parametered for each day
